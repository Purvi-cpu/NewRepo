# Student Study Portal
<br>
The project aims to ease the work of students. Instead of visiting several sites, 'The Study Portal' is a one-stop solution for it. Containing several features and a user-friendly UI.<br>

The problem we focused on:<br>
As a student, we usually log in to many sites, open wikis simultaneously, watch videos on some other tab and the browser gets filled with all the unnecessary tabs.<br>


How it solved the problem:<br>
The student portal can bring all the tabs to a single site. From a to-do list to getting youtube videos and making notes, everything will be saved in one place. With a fully flexible authentication system (We call it FFASðŸ˜†)
